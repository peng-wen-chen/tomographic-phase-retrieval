# tomographic-phase-retrieval
This is a project about tomographic phase retrieval.
Files are written in  matlab files.
The code is used to produce the results in the paper ``Toward Noisy One-Bit Diffraction Tomography"  in
https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05571.
The main program is Tomographic_Poisson.m, where we conduct 3-D tomographic phase retrieval on  objects, either phantom or RPP.
The  main algorithms consist of the null vector method and the AP method.
