# tomographic-phase-retrieval
This is the matlab files  for tomographic phase retrieval.
The code is used to produce the results in the paper ``Toward Noisy One-Bit Diffraction Tomography"  in
https://synthical.com/article/bec13a24-0220-4ea0-93aa-1d2d89913085.
The main program is Tomographic_Poisson.m, where we conduct 3-D tomographic phase retrieval on  objects, either phantom or RPP.
The  algorithms consist of the null vector method and the AP method.
